# Analysis-of-the-Invariant-Mass-Spectrum-of-Di-muon-Events
Implemented the Tag and Probe method on Run 2012 CMS di-muon datasets to evaluate muon reconstruction and identification efficiencies. Reconstructed the invariant mass spectrum of di-muon events and identified the Z → μ⁺μ⁻ resonance peak around 91 GeV as a validation of the selection criteria.
